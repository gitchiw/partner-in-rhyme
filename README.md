## ✨ How to Play

You can contribute in **two fun ways**:

### 1️⃣ Add a Rhyming Hello World 🌍
- Go to `hello-world/<language>/`
- Create a file like `hello.py` or `hello.js`
- Print a line that **rhymes**

**Examples**
- `hello-world/python/first-rhymes.py`
  ```python
  print("Hello, Web3 — a wordsmith in rhyme, learning to code one line at a time!")
- `hello-world/javascript/first-rhymes.js` 
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, Web3 — this wordsmith in rhyme, learning to code one line at a time!");

### 2️⃣ Add a Poem 📜
- Go to `poems/`
- Add a new file like `poems/haiku/my-first.md` or `poems/couplet/newbie.md`
- Write a short dev-themed poem (haiku, couplet, limerick)

**Examples**
- `poems/haiku/first-haiku.md`
```
A poet of words,
now crafting her path in code,
newbie on the chain.
```
- `poems/couplet/first-couplet.md`
```
From copy to code, I start the climb,
a Web3 newbie, but give me time.
```
