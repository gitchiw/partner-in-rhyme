# 🤝 Contributing to Partner in Rhyme

Welcome, fellow coder-poet\! 🎭  
This repo is all about mixing **code and rhyme**.  
Everyone is invited — beginners, pros, writers, and dreamers alike.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### Option A — Add a Rhyming Hello World 🌍

1. Create a folder under `hello-world/<language>/`.  
2. Add a simple program (e.g., `hello.py`, `hello.js`) that prints a line in rhyme.  
   Example in Python:  
     
   print("Hello, World — rhyme in time, commit your code, it feels sublime\!")

### Option B — Add a Poem 📜

1. Pick a folder under `poems/` (e.g., haiku/, couplet/, limerick/).

2. Add a new Markdown file with your poem (e.g., `my-first-haiku.md`).

3. Keep it short, fun, and dev-themed if possible.

### Option C — Commit in Rhyme ✍️

When making a commit, try a rhyming message:
```markdown
feat: add new rhyme — merged in time
fix: squash the bug — code feels snug
```
